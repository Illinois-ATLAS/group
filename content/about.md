Our experimental high-energy physics program is focused on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.  We are active in searches for beyond-the-standard model physics including supersymmetry, long-lived particles, and anomalous multi-boson production involving new resonances and final states involving Higgs bosons.

We also contribute to the ATLAS trigger system through Run 3 operations and upgrades to the Phase 2 trigger system, focusing on the development of novel charged particle tracking algorithms.

Our research benefits from our involvement with interdisciplinary centers such as the [Illinois Center for Advanced Study of the Universe](https://icasu.illinois.edu). We are developing machine learning approaches for a variety of analysis and reconstruction tasks, leveraging connections with the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu), the Center for [Artificial Intelligence (AI) Innovation](https://ai.ncsa.illinois.edu), and the NSF-funded Accelerated [AI Algorithms for Data Driven Discovery (A3D3) Institute](https://a3d3.ai).

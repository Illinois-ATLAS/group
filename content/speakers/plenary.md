<p><i>
Dr. Mark Neubauer is a professor and particle physicist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His is also affiliated faculty with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Generally speaking, his research aims to understand the universe at its most fundamental level, including the constituents of matter and their interactions. His current research is to search for physics beyond the standard model through a detailed study of high-energy proton-proton collisions at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. His research group searches for new physics using data from the ATLAS Experiment, with an emphasis on the Higgs boson as a sensitive new tool and applications of machine learning to enhance our sensitivity. His group is also working to improve the experimental methods and apparatus in high-energy physics, including advancing scientific software and computing and developing fast electronics for highly-parallelized systems that track charged particles at the LHC. He is also passionate about outreach and education in STEM fields, especially the creative use of technologies from data science to improve physics education.

### <span style="color:LightGreen">About the speaker</span><!-- omit in toc -->
<p><i>
Dr. Alex Pak is an Assistant Professor in Chemical and Biological Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. The “bottom-up” design of soft materials from self-assembled and/or self-organized molecular building blocks has broad applications in energy, sustainability, and healthcare. Thermodynamic and kinetic control over molecular structures, which can be hierarchical or dynamical in nature, presents new opportunities to explore emergent properties in these materials. Our vision is to rationally engineer materials through modification of molecular building blocks and environmental factors during preparation and operation. To do so, we interrogate the fundamental connections between microscopic interactions and macroscopic behavior under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. Our strategy is to develop and apply multiscale computational techniques – in particular, atomistic and coarse-grained simulations – to study structure-dynamics-function relationships and to identify guiding principles for materials tailored to specific applications. Current research interests include the design of plastic crystal electrolytes for electrochemical applications and the design of protein-based lattices for biomedical applications.
